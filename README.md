# TRex ðŸ¦–

TRex makes OCR easy and accessible on a Mac. 

But what is OCR anyway? Imagine you have a PDF file or a Web page where you can't select the text, image with text on it, or even a YouTube video. Forget retyping it manually; with TRex, you can extract text from anywhere, and it is as easy as taking a screenshot.

- A screenshot

If you can see it on your screen - TRex can copy it.
